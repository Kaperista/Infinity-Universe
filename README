# Infinity-Universe
This is already the second project, I hope everything works out.

Guide:

1. Download the HTML file.
2. Launch it in your browser (any).
3. You can enable audio in the top left, your own song, your microphone, or even turn on sounds.
4. Create your own star systems using the edit button.
5. You can turn off the UI and record videos with this background, or just leave it as a background to decorate your desktop.

Good luck!
